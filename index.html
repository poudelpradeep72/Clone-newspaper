                    For the first time, high-altitude guides will face some competition on Everest… from drones.

                    The Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, which hosts the 8,848.86 metre-tall Everest, is piloting heavy lifter drones that will bring back garbage from the mighty mountain.
                    
                    Though officials say that cargo drones will fly on Everest to bring garbage, its success, however, may affect the livelihood of high altitude support staff who navigate the dangerous Khumbu Icefall with tonnes of loads on their backs.

                    “It's a test. The success means we will use drones in a full-fledged manner to bring garbage from up to 6,500 metres of Camp II, next season,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the rural municipality. “We, however, have not discussed whether drones can be used to transport supplies and logistics to Camp II to reduce casualties on the notorious Khumbu Icefall.”
